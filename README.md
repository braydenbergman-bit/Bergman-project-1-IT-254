# Bergman-project-1-IT-254
Our project is we are creating a simple home security system that has face detection and will open a door if the person detected is accpeted and is apart of that home. If the person detected is not apart of that home, then the door will not open for them. This takes away the need for keys or having to remember passcodes that can be guessed.

Hardware used
We used a 3d printed door model that we got from Tinkercad https://www.tinkercad.com/things/jrjchUGjqYP/edit?returnTo=%2Fdashboard%2Fdesigns%2F3d. We also used the Ardunio Mega 2560 keypad with a motor connected to the door to open and close it. For the face detection we used the teachable machine in colab and used our cameras on our computers.

Instructions
Required hardware to make this work: -VSCode -Python 3.11 -Ardunio -Ardunio mega 2560 keypad - Audrino motor -small 3d printed door created using Tinkercad -Teachable machine -web cam

Getting the door to work
I was in charge of building the door. I made a prototype before they made up the face detection code so I made it with a motor that opens with a sensor and a box. I had researched improvements and with the help of Matt we had 3d printed a door. I then had to catch up with our face detection code and find a way to get it to update the audrino. I made the final code and also made the audrino code. I ofcourse had to test it and after I made sure it worked I went to pick up Matts 3d print while he was gone and tried to attach it to my old prototype. I had to make the door hole bigger but I realized that the door was quite heavy compared to my prototype and would need to make some way to support it. For this I took the whole thing to Matt's apartment where we worked together to finish it up along with filming a video and making hinges out of Q-tips. The only major problem I had with this project other than the difficulties with code was taping the door to the Q-tips and the motor. I think if we had better tape our project couldve been just as I imagined.
